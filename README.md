# Zombra
Zombra is an online text editor. Created for my capstone project at devCodeCamp. This project pushed me to my limits of what I knew and could achieve in two weeks. Coming up with user stories and creating a full web application. The web application was created with React and Flux. I spent the two weeks learning React and Flux to create this project.
